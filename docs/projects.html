                    Created an encrypted file/directory hierarchy with node-like data structures for a virtualized OS on QEMU.
                    Also implemented virtual memory by setting up the page tables for virtual-to-physical address mappings.
                    Added demand paging into virtual memory, an optimized method of reading disk pages into memory.
