                    Hi! I'm Kevin, and I like learning and making things. 
                    I also like exotically named dishes and tossing plastic discs, among other things.
                    <br><br> 
                    I am a sophomore at The University of Texas at Austin studying Computer Science and Mathematics as a Turing Scholar.
                    I'm passionate about creating software with a purpose and enjoy working with large amounts of data.
                    More specifically, I'm interested in the areas of machine learning, finance, and renewable energy.
                    <br><br>
                    Outside of school, when I'm not playing frisbee, <a href = "fun_stuff.html#baking"> baking bread</a>, 
                    convincing myself I can pick up piano again, or just hanging with friends, 
                    you can probably find me working on projects that allow me to explore my topics of interest
                    in the hopes of creating something that can improve my community and the lives of those with whom I share it.
                    <br><br>
